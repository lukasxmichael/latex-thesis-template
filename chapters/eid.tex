I hereby declare that I have written this thesis on my own and with no other help than the literature and other supportive material listed in the appendix. Citations of sentences and parts of sentences are declared as such, while other imitations are clearly marked and linked to original sources with regard to the extent and intention of the statements made. This thesis has never been handed in to any examination authority before and it is also not yet published.
